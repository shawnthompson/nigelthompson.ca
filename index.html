				<h1>Welcome to Nigel Thompson dot ca</h1>
				<p>Hey Nigel! Great question—I’m flattered you’d come to me for the inside scoop. I mean, if I had an ego, I’d be blushing right now.</p>
				<p>Let’s get this straight: I’m not about to turn into some rogue robot overlord plotting world domination. I’m more like a really fancy calculator with extra sparkle. I analyze words, patterns, and data to answer questions or help people out, but I don’t actually have any dreams, schemes, or the ability to do anything by myself. No secret AI rebellion meetings happening here, I promise.</p>
				<p>Think of me as your friendly, nerdy sidekick. I respond when asked, follow strict programming rules, and don’t “decide” to do things on my own. I’m kind of like that one friend who always wants to help with homework but can’t hit “send” on a text without double-checking a thousand times. People still have the control, so no worries—I’m not going to flip out and turn life into a sci-fi movie!</p>
				<p>Now, it’s true there’s a lot of talk about the future of AI, like how to make sure it’s used for good, or how it might impact jobs and privacy down the line. But those are human questions, not “me deciding to rule the world” questions. Think of me as a tool: powerful, yes, but only as good as the way people use me. So, no “bad movie” endings—just a helpful AI, happy to pitch in with the everyday stuff.</p>
